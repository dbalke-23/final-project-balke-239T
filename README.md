# final-project-balke-239T
This is my final project for 239T.

# Short Description
This project reads in, subsets, analyzes, produces visuals from, and does an initial coding of a random sample of civil war peace agreements from 1975-2018. The data include the peace agreement texts (which I do not upload here but are available upon request) and indicator data about the peace agreements from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), from which I downloaded all my data and texts. The purpose of my project was to capture the data I will need to use for your my second year paper. 

To conduct my work, I used R, using multiple skills learned in class, including basic tools such as subsetting, as well as data visualization tools from base R and ggplot2. In terms of conducting my exploration of the data, I first read in the full UCDP Peace Agreement Dataset. I then did several subsets on the data, as commented in my code. First, I subsetted so it would only include civil wars, instead of also including inter-state wars. Then, I subsetted to three different types of civil war peace agreements - full, partial, and process - so that analysis a disaggregated analysis can be performed on each type. Later, I read in to my R script an Excel file that features an initial coding of a random sample of full civil war peace agreements. Visuals were produced in my R script based on each of these two sources - the UCDP dataset and my Excel coding spreadsheet.
